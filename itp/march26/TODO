create dictionary object in lang
create call function which checks for method, checks arg numbers?, then calls function
call function could maybe have fuzziness/spellcheck
create shitty variable symbol table
put a bunch of default functions in that dictionary

recursion
arbitrary arg list length
conditionals: if, else, switch?
loops: for, while
define functions
blocks of code
booleans
primitives

draw diagrams?
arrows, lines
