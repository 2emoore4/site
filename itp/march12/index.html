                looking at the documentation, I was really annoyed that all of the example rules involved moving a block around. so I liked the idea of having a block that was really frustrating to move. I kinda went with that idea...<br><br>
                you control the white block, and the goal is to devour the black block. unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get the win condition to work. I think it's because the white and black blocks are on the same collision layer. but that's kinda necessary for the game to work. so just pretend that you win when you devour the black block.<br><br>
                after playing the game for like two seconds, controlling the black block isn't very frustrating. so I tried to make a little puzzle out of it. it's not that hard; I'm not good at making puzzles.<br><br>
                here's my code:<br><br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/2emoore4/9500707.js"></script>
