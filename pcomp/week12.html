                    my project has so far turned out to be a little different from what I had in my proposal. when I presented the project, the class' general consensus was that sonar would not be accurate enough to create a 3d model. I started looking around for different sensors and I found two rangefinders that use infrared lasers. they're kinda like sonar, but they're supposed to be more accurate. one of the rangefinders can measure from 20 cm to 150 cm. the other rangefinder is supposed to measure distances less than 20 cm. of course, I still purchased the sonar rangefinder, since that was the original aim of the project. the sensor I found can measure from 30 to 500 cm with a resolution of 1mm. hopefully this is accurate enough, but if not, I have the other two sensors. <br><br>so far, I've got all three sensors hooked up and functioning correctly. right now, I have a program that takes a reading from all three sensors ever half second. for each sensor, it records 9 distances. after that, it takes the mode from each array. if there is no mode, then it takes the median. this is much more accurate than taking an average because the data is not skewed by outliers. this is working pretty well so far. I think my readings will be very accurate if I record distances from 2 or three sensors at a time. <br><br>my next step is to make a basic sonar-type device, where I will mount the sensors onto one servo motor and it will measure all ranges in one direction. this is a good way to test and calibrate the device before moving on to three dimensions. <br><br>this is a picture of what I have so far. <br><br>
