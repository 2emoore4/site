                    last week, I tested all three of my sensors. I decided to get rid of that crappy light/proximity sensor because it just wasn't working very well. however, the sonar sensor and the infrared sensor worked really well for determining distance, as long as the sensors were stationary.<br><br>
                    my next test for the sensors was to mount them onto a single motor that would rotate in the x direction. this was a better test because it was easier to visualize on the screen. the motor simply rotated back and forth with a range of about 150 degrees and the sensors took a reading after every movement. I made a processing applet that displayed this distance data as dots. the dots are placed at the exact position where the sensor sees them. look further below for images and videos of this applet running.<br><br>
                    this test worked pretty well with the infrared sensor. all of the readings were very accurate, and the visualization was very smooth. once I tried it with the sonar sensor however, the readings were all over the place. they weren't accurate at all. I think this was because the sensor wouldn't work with rapid movement. since the sensor is sending out sound signals, it's possible that the sounds were lingering and interfering with new signals. I couldn't find a way to fix this. I continued with just the infrared sensor since it was working very well. the only downside is that it only had a range of 150cm. at this point, instead of being able to scan a whole room, I was limited to scanning only objects within 150cm. this isn't a huge issue though.
