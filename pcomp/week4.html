                            I could imagine a pressure sensor being used in electric wheelchairs for people with limited mobility. The users could press on the sensors to control the direction and speed of their wheelchair. This sensor could also be used to control one of those grabber things (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carex-Inch-Grabber-Reaching-Aid/dp/B000AEGCW6">this</a>) for people who are unable to squeeze the handle to lift items.

                        We use a voltage divider circuit for potentiometers, force-sensitive resistors, and many other sensors. Why do we not need to use a voltage divider circuit with this temperature sensor?<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            I'm not exactly sure, but it could be that this temperature sensor only has an output voltage from 0.1V to 2.0V, which is lower compared to the other sensors. If we used a voltage divider circuit, the voltage reading would be even lower, which might be more difficult for the arduino to read.

                    <li>
                        Unlike pressure sensed by force-sensitive resistors, or rotation sensed by potentiometers, ambient temperature sensed by temperature sensors almost always changes very gradually and slowly.  How does this affect the design of interactions based on this sensor?<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            Systems using a sensor like this would have to be much more sensitive. Since temperature changes are very gradual, a system would have to have a more noticable reaction. For example, in this circuit, I wasn't able to notice a change in the led brightness because the temperature change was not large enough.

                        Given the range of temperatures at which this sensor works, please give 2 ideas for applications of this sensor.  Applications may involve anything from scientific research to artistic endeavors, but they should necessitate the use of this sensor, as opposed to other sensors.<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            There could be some applications for this kind of sensor in cooking. There are some foods that might have to go back and forth between heating and cooling, and this sensor would be able to withstand an oven and even a freezer. The wide range of this sensor would also be useful in planetary exploration, where the temperature of a planet is estimated but not known. It would be able to record a wide variety of temperatures in case the planet is colder or warmer than expected.

                        Why is the LED turned on by the switch dimmer than the LED turned on by the transistor?<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            The part of the circuit with the switch has a higher-rated resistor than the other part. This means that the voltage drop across this led would be lower, and therefore, the led would be dimmer.

                        Give the approximate current flowing through each leg of the circuit (ignore any affect the transistor might have on the current flow or voltage drop).<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            The leg with the switch has 0.5 miliamps and the other leg has ~8.9 miliamps.

                        How does turning the potentiometer to maximum resistance affect the sensitivity of the circuit to the photo-resistor's signal, as compared to turning the potentiometer all the way to minimum resistance?<br>
                        <div class="blogAnswer">
                            This leg of the circuit acts as a voltage divider. When the potentiometer is turned to maximum resistance, the voltage sensed by the transistor is lower. With the potentiometer is turned to minimum resistance, the output voltage is higher.
